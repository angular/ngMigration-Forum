# Contributing to AngularJS/Angular Upgrade
We would love for you to contribute to AngularJS/Angular upgrade project and help make it even better than it is today! As a contributor, here are the guidelines we would like you to follow:

 - [Code of Conduct](#coc)
 - [Questions and Answers](#question)
    - [Submitting Issues](#submit-issue)
 - [Feature Requests](#feature)
 - [Missing a Feature/Tool/Documentation?](#feature)

## <a name="coc"></a> Code of Conduct
Help us keep Angular open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct][coc].

## <a name="question"></a> Questions and Answers
Here is where you can finally ask all those nitty gritty or general upgrade questions and have experts respond. The issues tab will be our questions and answers section. Any closed issue means we have concluded a good answer and any open means they still need an answer.

### <a name="submit-issue"></a> Submitting an Issue
Before you submit an issue, please search the issue tracker, maybe an issue for your problem already exists and the discussion might inform you of workarounds readily available.

We want to understand all the issues and often need code to understand your problem. In order to demonstrate your problem, we will systematically ask you to provide a minimal reproduction scenario using http://plnkr.co. Having a live, reproducible scenario gives us a wealth of important information without going back & forth to you with additional questions like:

- version of AngularJS used
- 3rd-party libraries and their versions
- and most importantly - a use-case that fails

A minimal reproduce scenario using http://plnkr.co/ allows us to quickly confirm a bug (or point out coding problem) as well as confirm that we are fixing the right problem. If plunker is not a suitable way to demonstrate the problem, please create a standalone git repository demonstrating the problem.

We will be insisting on a minimal reproduce scenario in order to save maintainers time and ultimately be able to fix more bugs. Interestingly, from our experience users often find coding problems themselves while preparing a minimal plunk. We understand that sometimes it might be hard to extract essentials bits of code from a larger code-base but we really need to isolate the problem before we can fix it.

You can file new issues by filling out our [new issue form](https://github.com/ellamaolson/BetaForum/issues/new).

## <a name="feature"></a> Missing a Feature/Tool/Documentation?
Since this is an opensource forum, it is up to you to add new features, tools, or documentation. We request that you follow our guidelines when adding new features and removing existing features. Please refer to the [terminology]() and [reasons for removing]() pages when adding or removing documents.
